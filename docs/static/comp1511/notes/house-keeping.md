# Housekeeping

## Make sure you have a partner

This is important.

## Make sure you know how to transfer files to your partner

This is also important.

### Simple way is:

```bash
scp localfile z55555555@cse.unsw.edu.au:~/path/to/your/file
```

```bash
scp -r localDirectory z55555555@cse.unsw.edu.au:~/path/to/your/directory
```

Or if not on the command line via Google Drive etc.

## Set up SSH

Have you configured an SSH key? Ask me how. It'll make your life easier.

## Don't forget to email me your questions

Email me or Max if you have problems. But do try to figure out your problems first with some simple debugging.
