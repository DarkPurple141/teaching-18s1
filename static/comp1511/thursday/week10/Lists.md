# Array
* Index access (+)
* Fixed sized at declaration and then they are concrete. (not quite true in some cases but dw)
* contiguous blocks

# Linked List
* You can only access the start (head) of list, and then must traverse list to find your element. (-)
* Dynamic sizing aspect, where we can add and remove elements to the start and end easily. (+)
* No such guarantee can be all over the place
